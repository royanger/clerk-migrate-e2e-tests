/**
 * The Clerk instances evals run against (evals/targets.json):
 *   pool     the eval targets: each run claims a free one, uses it, empties it
 *   source   Clerk as a migration *provider* (the migration eval exports from it)
 *   migrate  test:migrate's own instance
 *
 * Secret keys and app IDs come from the environment (op.env), named by
 * `keyEnv` and `appEnv` (or `app` gives the ID itself); the instance ID is
 * looked up from the key (BAPI GET /v1/instance) unless the file gives it.
 * Locks are per instance ID, so an instance listed twice (evals-1 is also
 * test:migrate's instance) is still only used by one run at a time.
