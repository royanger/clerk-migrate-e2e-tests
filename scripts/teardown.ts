/**
 * Resets a Clerk migration-test instance back to its baseline so the next round
 * of testing starts from a known state. Wraps the Clerk CLI — nothing here talks
 * to the Backend API directly, so whatever `clerk whoami` is signed in as is what
 * gets changed.
 *
 *   pnpm teardown                      pick an instance, confirm before deleting
 *   pnpm teardown -y                   skip the "delete N users?" prompt
 *   pnpm teardown -n                   dry run: links, then reports without changing
 *   pnpm teardown --cli <path/to/cli.ts>   run a local CLI build via bun
 *
 * --cli swaps `clerk ...` for `bun --env-file=<cli>/.env.local <path> ...` and
 * changes nothing else. The env file is found by walking up from cli.ts. A local
 * build talks to a local backend and frontend API, so it sees a different set of
 * applications than the hosted CLI — expect different app ids there.
 *
 * A dry run still runs `clerk link`, because the whole point of the link step is
 * that `clerk doctor` and bare `clerk` commands afterwards point at the instance
 * you picked. Nothing else is touched.
 *
 * The instance picker is built from `clerk apps list`, so it only ever offers
 * instances that actually exist — a production instance shows up the run after it
 * is created, and an app without one simply contributes one row instead of two.
 *
 * This deletes every user in the selected instance. There is no undo, so the
 * app name and environment are printed before anything is touched.
