/**
 * Clerk as a source (C1–C6 in .testing-plan.md): a Clerk-to-Clerk migration.
 *
 * Source and destination are the same dev instance. The runner seeds, exports,
 * then calls reset() — which empties the instance — before it imports, so the
 * import lands on an empty instance just as a dev → prod move would.
 *
 * What `clerk migrate export clerk` can carry (export/clerk.ts): identifiers,
 * names, the three metadata blobs, banned, created_at and a few account flags.
 * The Backend API never returns password digests, TOTP secrets or backup
 * codes, so those never come across — "partial" for passwords and MFA in
 * `clerk migrate sources` means *a Dashboard export* carries them, the CLI's
 * own export does not. Every variation therefore expects 0 passwords.
