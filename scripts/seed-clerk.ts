/**
 * Seeds a Clerk development instance from data/users.json (or SEED_USERS_FILE).
 *
 * Email addresses are rewritten to the +clerk_test subaddress on the way in.
 * Clerk only treats those as test addresses — it will not send them mail, and
 * they verify with the fixed code 424242. The master JSON stays clean.
 * The 555-01XX phone numbers are already test numbers as generated.
 *
 * Also writes the optional edge-case fields the migration tests set: metadata
 * (public/private/unsafe), banned, and TOTP + backup codes (`mfa`). See
 * scripts/lib/clerk-source.ts.
 *
 * Enable first: Dashboard -> Configure -> Email, phone, username
 *   Identifiers: Email address, Phone number, Username
 *   Strategies:  Password, Email verification code, SMS verification code
 * (variations/clerk.ts does this through `clerk config patch`).
 *
 * Run: pnpm seed -p clerk
